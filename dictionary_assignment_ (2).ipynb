    "\n",
    "### 1. **Using `dict.get()` Method**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Using Lists as Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "#One simple way to store multiple values for a single key is to use a list. Each key in the dictionary can point to a list of values.\n",

    "print(my_dict['apple'])  # Output: [5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Using Sets as Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "#If you need to store unique values for each key (i.e., no duplicates), you can use sets instead of lists. Sets automatically handle duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {\n",
    "    'apple': {5, 10, 15},\n",

    "### 5. **Using a Dictionary of Dictionaries (Nested Dictionary)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#Sometimes, you might want to store multiple values for each key, where each of those values is itself a key-value pair. This can be done by using nested dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",

    "print(my_dict['apple'])  # Output: {'red': 5, 'green': 10, 'yellow': 12}\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Using `pandas` DataFrame for Multiple Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "#If you need to handle more complex scenarios with rows and columns of multiple values, consider using the `pandas` library, which provides a powerful way to handle data in tabular form (i.e., rows and columns).\n",

    "\n",
    "#For more advanced use cases, you can use the `reduce()` function from the `functools` module, which allows you to apply a function cumulatively to the items in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#If you're working with a large dataset or performing other numerical operations, you might use the `numpy` library, which is optimized for numerical computing.\n",

    "\n",
    "#If your dictionary has nested dictionaries and you want to sum the values in the inner dictionaries as well, you'll need a recursive approach.\n",

    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "#- **`sum()` with `values()`**: The most straightforward method for summing numeric values in a dictionary.\n",
    "#- **`for` loop**: Useful for manual control of the summing process.\n",
    "#- **`reduce()` from `functools`**: A more functional programming approach.\n",

    "### 5. Using `collections.ChainMap` (for multiple dictionaries)\n",
    "#If you want to merge multiple dictionaries and maintain their original order, `ChainMap` from the `collections` module allows you to group them together. This is useful if you don't want to modify the dictionaries.\n",

    "#To find the **common elements** in three sorted arrays using a dictionary intersection approach, we can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "#1. **Use a dictionary to track the occurrences** of elements in each array.\n",
    "#2. **Add elements to the dictionary** while iterating through the arrays.\n",
    "#3. **Check the frequency of each element**. If the element appears in all three arrays, it is a common element.\n",
    "#4. **Efficiently traverse the sorted arrays** to minimize comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps:\n",
    "#- We'll use the **dictionary's keys** to store the elements.\n",
    "#- As we iterate over each sorted array, we'll count the occurrences of each element.\n",
    "#- After processing all three arrays, we'll look for keys that have a count of 3 (i.e., elements that are present in all three arrays).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",

    "#- The approach using a dictionary is **simple** and **straightforward**, and it works efficiently even if the arrays are not sorted.\n",

    "#To replace words in a string using a dictionary in Python, where the dictionary maps old words (keys) to new words (values), you can iterate over the string and replace the words accordingly.\n",

    "#1. **`word_dict.items()`**: This gives key-value pairs from the dictionary, where the keys are words to be replaced and the values are the new words.\n",
    "#2. **`text.replace(old_word, new_word)`**: This replaces all occurrences of `old_word` with `new_word` in the string `text`.\n",

    "### Method 3: **Using `str.split()` and List Comprehension**\n",
    "\n",
    "#If you're only concerned with replacing words and don't need regular expressions, you can split the string into words and then use a dictionary to replace the words.\n",

    "### Scenario 1: **Remove Duplicate Values Across All Lists in the Dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "#If the dictionary values are **lists**, and you want to remove duplicate values from **each list** within the dictionary, here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample dictionary with lists as values\n",
    "my_dict = {\n",
    "    'a': [1, 2, 3, 1],\n",

    "    'c': [7, 8, 9]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "#- **`set()`** removes duplicates since sets cannot contain duplicate values.\n",
    "#- **`list(set(...))`** converts the set back to a list, but note that using a set will **not preserve the original order** of the elements.\n",
    "#- If order matters, use a more advanced approach (like using an ordered set or maintaining the order manually).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "#- **Intersection**: `counter1 & counter2` computes the intersection of the two counters, keeping the **minimum frequency** for each common element.\n",

    "#- **Sets** are useful for checking if the unique keys (elements) are the same, but they don't help with frequency counts directly.\n",
    "#- The **intersection** of `Counter` objects (`&`) can help check if two collections have common elements with matching frequencies, and if one can be rearranged to match the other.\n",
